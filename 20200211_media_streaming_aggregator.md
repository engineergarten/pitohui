## Description
There are a lot of streaming services today - music and video (games in some sense). But you cannot use only one and have access to all media content you want. The video situation is the most terrible. Content search, tracking, ratings are all scattered over different platforms. It would be nice to get search, playlists, own ratings and labels in one place.
