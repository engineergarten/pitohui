## Description
Most telegram bots for small business or local government bureaus ([109 bot](t.me/astanaikomek109_bot) for example) have typical functional with menu and adding/removing new buttons with some messages, images etc, sometimes they have integration with CRM API etc.
Usually, these bots have a build-in admin panel, with just menu with reply/inline keyboards in a bot itself, it's not user-friendly moreover work with adding/editing new submenus, in this case, is messy and frustrating. The idea here is to create a bot (or bot-constructor) with admin panel in the form of web interface (front end) with some basic functionality, like creating/editing menus, messages on buttons, in further it would nice to have some assets like a spam filter for groups, basic external API integrations via web interface etc.
